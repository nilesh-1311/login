# login
This project is a fully functional Login and Registration Authentication system built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to create an account, log in with stored credentials, and access a secured dashboard page.  User data is stored in the browser using Local Storage, enabling persistent login credentials without a backend server.
